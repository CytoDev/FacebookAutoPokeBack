# FacebookAutoPokeBack
This script is meant to be used in combination with a userscript in order to
correctly function. If you don't have a userscriptt plug-in installed now would
be a good time to look for one you like.

## Usage:
Link to this file (either from the master branche, or a version tag) inside your
userscript in order to use the functionality provided. There is only one
configurable in this whole script; the option to not poke some people back
automatically.
